            <h1>BonziWORLD FAQ</h1>
            <h3>Where to contact?</h3>
            Discord server or the owner's DMs for any enquiry, ban appeal, or to report a moderator for abusing powers. If it's an appeal/report provide screenshots.
			<h3>Do/will you make money from this?</h3>
            No. I spend very little money on this, and even if I wanted to make some money advertisers don't want to advertise here. It's not worth making BonziWORLD look like complete ass for $0.000000000001 a decade anyways.
            <h3>Will you add this color?</h3>
            I added /crosscolor so people would shut the fuck up about extra colors.
            <h3>Give me kingmode (moderator)</h3>
            no begging. if i don't trust you i won't give you kingmode
            <h3>When is [BW VERSION] releasing?</h3>
            I don't know. This isn't a job, I have no deadlines for this stuff. AND ALSO i have school
